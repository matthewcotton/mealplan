# Recipe Planner 

### About this project
Meal planning and recipe management application built using React, Express and SCSS, with a Mongodb database. This was our final group project with The Developer Academy Bootcamp where we were tasked with creating a new concept application and building out the project with an agile workflow over 4 weeks.

The application allows you to sign up with a username  and password, and log in to your account where you can add your own recipes to your account. The main feature of the application is being able to generate a mealplan for 7 or 14 days that randomly selects recipes you've added to your account.
